# Feature Rules – Financial Filings

## 1. Scope

This feature handles:

- financial statement documents from EDINET or TDNET
- XBRL and related metadata
- Per-day document retrieval

---

## 2. Collector Rules

- EDINET client fetches documents for a single date
- No date loops inside the EDINET client
- No storage calls inside the EDINET client

---

## 3. Domain Rules

- Document metadata must include:
  - document ID
  - filing date
  - company identifier
- Financial statements are immutable
- Raw data must be preserved

---

## 4. Ingestion Rules

- EDINET ingestion loops over days
- Each document is saved independently
- Failures on one day must not corrupt others

---

## 5. Storage Guarantees

- One document = one directory
- Metadata and raw files must coexist
- Paths must remain backward-compatible

---

## 6. Guiding Principle

> EDINET is a data source, not a workflow.

The ingestion layer owns time.
